        "Yayy we finished one month! I can't believe it, and it's crazy how it feels like it was just yesterday we started talking. You're the sweetest, most patient boy I've met, I love you so much! Sometimes I express too much, sometimes not enough, and sometimes I don't say what's on my mind. Sometimes I say things I don't end up meaning in an attempt to not end up saying what I actually feel, you've been so calm with me through all that. You have the sweetest smile and big brown eyes full of love, hope and dreams. I hope nothing takes that light away from you. I pray that as time passes, we only keep wanting more of each other! I love you <3"
